# Removing Roles

!!! tip
    Before we continue this is NOT the command to remove a reaction role from a message that you've setup previously, this command allows you to setup a reaction role to remove another role. (Example: I have a system in my personal server where when a user is "soft muted", they get kicked into only one channel where they can read the rules again, and if they click a reaction, it will unmute them. This is what this would do.)

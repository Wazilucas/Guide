    Before we start, Zira will need the `Add Reaction` permission for the reaction to appear on the message.

### Description

Add a normal role to the message you've set. Allows the user to have any amount of roles from a message. This is useful for notification roles, platform roles, etc.

    You've successfully added a standard react role with Zira. You can repeat this as many times as you'd like, but be aware that Discord only allows a max of 20 reactions per message. Ff you plan on adding more than 20 roles, you'll have to add reactions to multiple messages, which works just as well.

# Preparing Zira

Hey there, thanks for giving Zira a try, in this guide we will walk you through, step by step, how to setup Zira.

!!! tip "Before We Start"
    You will need the `Manage Server` permission to invite Zira.

Invite Zira with this [link](https://zira.pw/invite). Make sure you either give all the permissions on the invite link for Zira to work properly or give Zira your own custom bot role, that contains all the permissions listed in photo below.

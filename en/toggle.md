# Adding Toggled Roles

Before we start, Zira will need the `Add Reaction` permission for the reaction to appear on the message.

### Command Usage

***Or***

```z/toggle Emoji Role```

### Description

Add a toggled role to the message you've set. Allows the user to only have one toggled role per message. This is useful for color roles, etc.
